Currently working on **Backend Integration** to make the app fully functional! 🎯

## 🤔 Why Vanilla JavaScript?

Choosing **vanilla JavaScript** helps in mastering core programming concepts before using frameworks. Without relying on abstractions, developers gain **a deep understanding** of JavaScript’s principles, making it easier to adopt frameworks like React later.

### 📌 How It Helps in Frameworks

- **React & Other Frameworks** build on core JavaScript concepts.
- **Understanding the fundamentals** helps in using the Virtual DOM, state management, and component-based architectures effectively.
- **"Learn once, write anywhere"** → Mastering JavaScript first makes using any framework easier.

## 🏗 Contributions and Technologies

This project meticulously implements **core JavaScript concepts**, including:
- **Media Session API** → Enhanced media control.
- **History API** → Better navigation and state management.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** → Added keyboard response support.
- **Search Functionality** → Quick access to favorite songs.

With these refinements, my **Spotify clone** offers a **comprehensive and enhanced** music streaming experience for modern users.
